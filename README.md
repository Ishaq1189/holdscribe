## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### macOS Permissions

**Required**: Grant accessibility permissions for keyboard monitoring.

1. Open **System Settings** ‚Üí **Privacy & Security** ‚Üí **Accessibility**
2. Click the **lock** üîí and authenticate  
3. Click **+** and add your terminal app (Terminal.app, Ghostty, iTerm2, etc.)
4. Enable the checkbox for your terminal

### Enhanced Security Mode

```bash
# Prompt for permission before each recording
holdscribe --prompt-permissions

# Combine with other options
holdscribe --key f8 --prompt-permissions --model tiny
```

This prompts for explicit consent before each recording session.

### Recommended Keys

- **`alt_r` (Right Alt)** - Doesn't interfere with typing
- **`f8`, `f9`, `f10`** - Great for terminal use
- **Avoid `space`** - Will type spaces during normal use

## üéØ How It Works

1. **Hold trigger key** - Starts audio recording from your microphone
2. **Speak naturally** - Audio is captured while key is held down
3. **Release trigger key** - Recording stops, processing begins
4. **Whisper transcription** - OpenAI Whisper converts speech to text
5. **Auto-paste** - Transcribed text is typed at your cursor position

## üö® Troubleshooting

### "This process is not trusted" Error

You need to grant accessibility permissions:
- System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Accessibility
- Add your terminal app and enable it

### Permission Issues

HoldScribe handles permissions gracefully:
1. **First run**: Prompts to grant accessibility permissions
2. **Enhanced security**: Use `--prompt-permissions` for consent before each recording
3. **Graceful fallback**: Continues with limited functionality if permissions denied

### Key Not Detected

Some keys may not work on all systems:
- **Right Alt not working?** Try `f8` or `f9`
- **Right Control not working?** Use `alt_r` or function keys
- Test with debug output to see what keys are detected

### Audio Issues

- Ensure microphone permissions are granted
- Check your default audio input device
- Try running with `sudo` temporarily to test

### Whisper Model Loading

First run downloads the Whisper model (~74MB for base model). This is normal and only happens once.

## üí° Tips

- **Terminal Usage**: Function keys like `F8` work great in terminals
- **Text Editors**: Right Alt key is perfect for coding/writing
- **Longer Speech**: Hold key for entire sentence/paragraph for best results
- **Background Noise**: Whisper handles reasonable background noise well
- **Multiple Languages**: Whisper supports many languages automatically

## üîí Privacy

- **All processing is local** - No data sent to external servers
- **No audio storage** - Recordings are temporary and deleted immediately
- **Open source** - Full code available for inspection

## üìã System Requirements

- **OS**: macOS 10.15+ (tested on macOS 14+)
- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **Memory**: 2GB+ RAM recommended
- **Storage**: 1GB for Whisper models
- **Microphone**: Any built-in or USB microphone
