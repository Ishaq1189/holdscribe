## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **macOS** (tested on macOS 14+)
- **Microphone access** (will be requested on first run)
- **Accessibility permissions** for keyboard monitoring

### Installation

1. **Clone or download** this repository
2. **Setup the environment**:
   ```bash
   make setup
   ```

3. **Start using**:
   ```bash
   make run
   ```

That's it! Hold the **Right Alt key** and speak. Release to transcribe.

## 📖 Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Start with Right Alt key (recommended)
make run

# Or manually
./voice-transcribe.sh --key alt_r
```

### Alternative Trigger Keys

```bash
# Function keys (great for terminals)
make run-f8
make run-f9

# Space bar (be careful - types spaces normally too)
make run-space

# Or manually specify any key
./voice-transcribe.sh --key f10
```

### Available Keys

- **Function keys**: `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, `f4`, `f5`, `f6`, `f7`, `f8`, `f9`, `f10`, `f11`, `f12`
- **Modifier keys**: `alt_r`, `cmd_r`, `shift_r`, `ctrl`, `space`
- **Other keys**: `caps_lock`, `tab`, `home`, `end`, `page_up`, `page_down`

### Enhanced Security Mode

For users who want extra security, HoldScribe can prompt for permission before each recording:

```bash
# Prompt for permissions before each recording
holdscribe --prompt-permissions

# Combine with other options
holdscribe --key f8 --prompt-permissions --model tiny
```

This mode will ask for your explicit consent every time before:
- Monitoring keyboard input
- Recording audio
- Processing speech with AI
- Pasting transcribed text

## 📦 Installation Methods

### Homebrew (Recommended)
```bash
brew tap ishaq1189/holdscribe
brew install holdscribe
```

### Manual Installation
Follow the manual setup instructions below for development or custom installations.

### Whisper Models

Choose between speed and accuracy:

```bash
# Fastest (tiny model)
make run-tiny

# Good balance (small model) 
make run-small

# More accurate (medium model)
make run-medium

# Most accurate (large model)
make run-large
```

| Model  | Speed | Accuracy | Size |
|--------|-------|----------|------|
| tiny   | ⚡⚡⚡ | ⭐⭐   | ~39MB |
| base   | ⚡⚡   | ⭐⭐⭐ | ~74MB |
| small  | ⚡     | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ~244MB |
| medium | 🐌     | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ~769MB |
| large  | 🐌🐌   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ~1550MB |

## ⚙️ Configuration

### macOS Permissions

**Required**: Grant accessibility permissions for keyboard monitoring.

1. Open **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → **Accessibility**
2. Click the **lock** 🔒 and authenticate  
3. Click **+** and add your terminal app (Terminal.app, Ghostty, iTerm2, etc.)
4. Enable the checkbox for your terminal

### Recommended Keys

- **`alt_r` (Right Alt)** - Perfect for most users, doesn't interfere with typing
- **`f8`, `f9`, `f10`** - Great for terminal use, easy to reach
- **Avoid `space`** - Will type spaces when you normally type

## 🛠️ Make Commands

```bash
# Running
make run          # Start with right Alt key
make run-f8       # Start with F8 key
make run-space    # Start with space bar

# Models
make run-tiny     # Fastest transcription
make run-small    # Good balance
make run-medium   # More accurate
make run-large    # Most accurate

# Setup & Maintenance
make setup        # Initial setup (create venv + install)
make install      # Install dependencies only
make clean        # Remove virtual environment
make help         # Show all commands
```

## 🔧 Manual Setup

If you prefer manual setup:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv voice-transcribe-env

# Activate it
source voice-transcribe-env/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install openai-whisper pyaudio pynput pyperclip

# Make script executable
chmod +x voice-transcribe.sh

# Run with basic permissions
./voice-transcribe.sh --key alt_r

# Run with enhanced security (prompts each time)
python3 holdscribe.py --prompt-permissions
```

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Hold trigger key** - Starts audio recording from your microphone
2. **Speak naturally** - Audio is captured while key is held down
3. **Release trigger key** - Recording stops, processing begins
4. **Whisper transcription** - OpenAI Whisper converts speech to text
5. **Auto-paste** - Transcribed text is typed at your cursor position

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "This process is not trusted" Error

You need to grant accessibility permissions:
- System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility
- Add your terminal app and enable it

### Permission Issues on New Systems

HoldScribe now handles permissions more gracefully:
1. **First run**: Prompts to grant accessibility permissions
2. **Enhanced security**: Use `--prompt-permissions` for consent before each recording
3. **Graceful fallback**: Continues with limited functionality if permissions denied

```bash
# Standard mode (one-time permission check)
holdscribe

# Enhanced security mode (prompts every time)
holdscribe --prompt-permissions
```

### Key Not Detected

Some keys may not work on all systems:
- **Right Alt not working?** Try `f8` or `f9`
- **Right Control not working?** Use `alt_r` or function keys
- Test with debug output to see what keys are detected

### Audio Issues

- Ensure microphone permissions are granted
- Check your default audio input device
- Try running with `sudo` temporarily to test

### Whisper Model Loading

First run downloads the Whisper model (~74MB for base model). This is normal and only happens once.

## 💡 Tips

- **Terminal Usage**: Function keys like `F8` work great in terminals
- **Text Editors**: Right Alt key is perfect for coding/writing
- **Longer Speech**: Hold key for entire sentence/paragraph for best results
- **Background Noise**: Whisper handles reasonable background noise well
- **Multiple Languages**: Whisper supports many languages automatically

## 🔒 Privacy

- **All processing is local** - No data sent to external servers
- **No audio storage** - Recordings are temporary and deleted immediately
- **Open source** - Full code available for inspection

## 📋 System Requirements

- **OS**: macOS 10.15+ (tested on macOS 14+)
- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **Memory**: 2GB+ RAM recommended
- **Storage**: 1GB for Whisper models
- **Microphone**: Any built-in or USB microphone
